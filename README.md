# My-studio-website

This is a task done in level 1 of my HyperionDev Bootcamp. It's a website
with various functionality: Local storage, clearing local storage, email,
whatsapp, video player, audio player and jQuery/css animations.
It is a mockup project/website for my home studio with various offerings. It
gives surface level insight of my career as a musician over the years.

**Index/Home Page:**
The screen loads with animation only the first time, because a user is required

This page contains a section for links to educational videos on the left, divided into 
3 sections (guitar, bass and production). Each resource has a save and like function. If you click
"save" then link and description will be saved for later use in the "Saved Folder" page. Each time
the user is notified how many items they have in their folder. The folder can be cleared from
within the folder page.
There is a comments section that is also stored. It can too, be cleared from local storage by
clicking on the "clear" button. To return home, click on the house (home logo).

**Performance:**

Whatsapp function asks a user for their international cell phone number and name. The user can then
have Whatsapp web open and share the URL of my website page with their contacts.
